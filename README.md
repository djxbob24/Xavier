# Hello, Xavier
I am somoeone who wants to utilize their genuine interest in technology and learn as much as I can about Cybersecurity.

I have basic knowledge and experience using Python and another program of programming, I took a course in my senior year of high school and that is when I decided to pursure and learn about this industry. I also have loved learning little by little about computers for both the hardware of the device and how programming itself works, I want to be able to learn the skills in order to ensure proper safety for when the devices espeically for those that don't know much about their devices and the dangers when using them.

I have a kanck of typing at a moderate speed which may be useful for this type of skill. 
I can retain information from learning something new a lot more quicker than some.

Cybersecurity sparked in interest in me when I started to learn about how viruses and malware can happen, but also how to prevent them. I did not understabd how they operated or how dangerous they can be if left unchecked.
I want to use this as a learning experience for not only myself but for others that have a curiosity of this industry.
I believe with the mindset I have for learning about the expanding world of technology and Cybersecurity itself, that I can further expand upon that knowledge and use it for something good. It is unfortunate for those that don't have the general safety information of using these devices that they are capable of having personal data and information taken away from them. I would like to do my part and ensure that everyone's privacy and personal information is rightfully their own and not to be stolen or used against them.
